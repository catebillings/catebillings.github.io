            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my name is Cate Billings, and I use she/her pronouns.
            I am a Creative Technology and Design major with a minor in Business. I am originally
            from Highlands Ranch, CO, but I now live in Boulder, CO. I am studying Creative Technology and
            Design because I want to work for a technology start up company in the future, hopefully doing
            some sort of design work with them. I am also very passionate about writing. I am a member of
            Her Campus CU Boulder, which allows for me to write and publish articles online.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my hobbies inculde playing ukulele, sketching, and cooking. I have
            been playing ukulele for about six years. I write my own songs and also cover other artist's songs.
            I use sketching as a way to relax, usually while listening to an audiobook. Finally, I am passionate
            about making good, high quality food, such as my famous fettuccinne alfredo recipe.
