            <p>Assignment 3, an encyclopedia page, was a great assignment becuase we got to learn how to lay out a page.</p>

            <p>I liked in-class activity 8 because it was my first time learning javascript.</p>

            <p>Assignment 8, a silly story generator, was super fun because I got to be creative while learning
                the basics of javascript.</p>

            <p>In class activity 10, a bouncing balls simulation, was one of my favorites because it showed how 
                easy it is to create cool imagery with javascript.</p>

            <p>Finally, my absolute favorite assignment was assignment 12. We got to make a bad phone number input. 
                It was funny to see what everyone in the class came up with.</p>
