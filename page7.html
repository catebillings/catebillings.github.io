            Lab 7 introduces how to create interactive animations and visualizations using Processing. Also, it shows how to connect those visualizations to 
            the Arduino and control them using electronics. I learned about Processing and how to use it, and how to set up serial communication between Processing and 
            the Arduino. I was able to explore the depths of Processing and create my own creative, interactive visual.

        <h3 class = "siteh3">Part 3: Creating Your Own Visualization</h3>
        <p class = "sitep">
            For part 3 I decided to create a visual where the user can change the backround color by pressing different buttons or turning a potentionmeter. One button turns 
            the background blue and the other button turns the background red. Finally, when the potentiometer is turned all the way up, the background turns green. 
            First, I built the circuit. A picture of the physical circuit is shown below.

            Lab 4 introduces interacting with electrical circuits in a more advanced fasion using analog input. This lab taught me how to 
            use Arduino to take analog measurements from componenets like a potentiomter and an analog joystick, which is like a multi-dimensional 
            potentiomter. I used these inputs to control different LED arrangements, and I attempted to create a simple 
            Whack-a-mole game.

            components that get connected. Soldering is extremely useful in electrical prototyping.

                To me, the type of wire that was easier to solder was the solid-core. The stranded wire kept separating despite my best efforts, so 
                it was more difficult to get through the holes in the protoboard.

                In this part of the lab, I conneted the joints made in the previous part to each other by trace soldering. I applied solder on
                two adjacent holes in the protoboard, then I deposited more solder onto them while molding the solder to form a bridge between the two holes.
                I repeated this until I had three traces, pictured below.

                I first set up the Arduino IDE, and I connected my board to my laptop using the USB cable. Below is a

        <h3 class = "siteh3">Part 2: Blinking an External LED</h3>
            <p class = "sitep">
                This portion of the lab consisted of using Digital Output to blink an external LED. The term Digital implies binary.
                It can be 1 or 0, or HIGH or LOW, which are called levels. In terms of electricity, however, HIGH means a certain voltage
                (could be 3.3V or 5V or more), while LOW means 0V. In the Arduino, we can program the digital pins to be HIGH/LOW,
                which will turn that pin to 5V (HIGH), or 0V (LOW). In order to get the LED connected to the Arduino to blink, I modified 
                the "blink" sample code from earlier in the lab. In order to get the LED to blink on pin 10, I first declared a global 
                variable equal to 10 outside both functions. Then, I replaced "LED_BUILTIN" with "LED_PIN," which is the name of the variable.
                My code and a video of the LED blinking are pictured below.

            <p class = "sitep">
                Next, I wanted to change the blinking period for the LED. I decreased the delay to 100 ms, so the LED blinked much faster. 
                The new code and video of the LED blinking faster are pictured below.

        <h3 class = "siteh3">Part 3: Button Press and Serial Monitor</h3>
            <p class = "sitep">
                I started this part of the lab by adding a digital input button switch to the circuit. The new circuit is pictured in the

                Furthermore, I learned how to use the Serial Monitor. First I created code that simply prints a statement repeatedly. The code and 
                an image of it working are pictured below.
            </p>

                After this, I used the Serial Monitor to print a waiting message while waiting for the button to be pressed and a success message
                once the button is pressed. Below is the code I used and a video of it working.
            </p>

            <p class = "sitep">The button state oscillates a few times even when I just press the button once. I think this is caused by the if statement repeating itself
                before the button is pressed. I think implementing while loops could help to resolve this issue.

        <h3 class = "siteh3">Part 4: LED Reaction Game</h3>
            <p class = "sitep">
                This is my code for the LED Reaction Game. To explain the program flow, the game overall starts with a welcome and ready statement that only prints once 
                becasue it is in the setup() function. Once the program moves on the loop function, it uses digitalRead to check if the input pin is HIGH or LOW. While it is 
                LOW, it calculates a random number between .5 seconds and 5 seconds, then inputs that number into the delay. Once the delay is done, the program caluclates 
                the time it has been since the program started, and it turns on the LED using digitalWrite. Once the user pushes the button, the program moves to the 
                second while loop. Here, it turns the LED off using digitalWrite. Then, it calculates the time it took to press the button using the "startTime" measurement 
                from the first while loop. Finally, it prints the reaction time and implements a 5 second delay for the player to get ready.

            Lab 1 introduces electronics and simple circuits. It explores how current flows through components
            and how to control the path of electricity. In this lab, I began by learning how to properly set up a power 
            supply using a 9V battery and a Power Supply Module. Then, I learned how to create simple circuits using first a 
            3.3V power supply then a 5V power supply and different resistors. Finally, I learned how to incorporate a 
            switch in the form of a button in order to turn the LED on and off using the button.

        <h3 class = "siteh3">Part 1: Setting Up Power</h3>
            <p class = "sitep">
                First, I connected the Power Supply Module, which is capable of converting the 9V battery to both 5V and 
                3.3V, to the breadboard. I did it such that the '+' and '-' symbols on both sides of the module matched the 
                '+' (red) and '-' (blue) markings on the breadboard. Then, I connected the 9V battery to the barrel jack connector
                on the power module. I pressed the white on/off button on the module to ensure that the power was working. I 
                knew this because the green LED on the power module turned on when power was being supplied. The correct set up is pictured below.

                Next, I connected two jumper wires and connected one end of each to a pin on the blue/red power lines on the breadboard.
                I used the multimeter to probe the two jumper wires to test the voltage on either side to ensure one side was reading around
                3.3V, and the other side was reading around 5V. My measurments are pictured below.

        <h3 class = "siteh3">Part 2: (Not) Blowing Up An LED</h3>
            <p class = "sitep">
                This portion of the lab required calculating the amount of resistance required to properly set up a circuit with a LED.
                A resistor is required to control the current flowing through the LED, so that it doesn't 'blow up' from too much current.
                The calculation for the amount of resistance required can be performed using Ohm's Law: V = IR. The LEDs I used for this lab 
                had a max current rating of 40 mA, so a current of about 20 mA t0 35 mA was appropriate for safely running the LED. Below is the 
                calculation provided for determining the resistance requried when powering the LED with a 3.3V source.
            </p>
            <p class = "sitep">V = I * R</p>
            <p class = "sitep">R = V / I</p>
            <p class = "sitep">R = 3.3V / 30 mA = 110 Ohm</p>
            <p class = "sitep">
                Because I did not have a 110 Ohm reistor, I set up the circuit using a 100 Ohm resistor. Below is a schematic of the circuit
                and a picture of the physical circuit I created.

            <p class = "sitep">
                I next created a circuit for the LED using the 5V power source. I started by calculating the resistance required using a 5V power sources and 
                a current of 20 mA. Then, I calculate the resistance required using a 5V power sources and a current of 35 mA. I averaged the two resistance values, and 
                I chose a resistor that was close to that average. Below are my calculations.
            </p>
            <p class = "sitep">V = I * R</p>
            <p class = "sitep">R = V / I</p>

            <p class = "sitep">R = 5V / 35 mA = 140 Ohm</p>
            <p class = "sitep">Average = ((250 Ohm + 140 Ohm) / 2) = 195 Ohm</p>
            <p class = "sitep">
                Because I did not have a 195 Ohm reistor, I set up the circuit using a 220 Ohm resistor. Below is a schematic of the circuit

            <p class = "sitep">
                In this part of the lab, I learned how to control the LED by turning it on/off using a switch. The switch I used was a Push Button, a Single-pole, single-throw
                (SPST) switch. This means it has one output and one input. It is also a type of momentary switch, which means it is only connected when it is pushed down. I incorporated
                the push button into the 3.3V source and 100 Ohm resistor circuit as shown below.

        <h3 class = "siteh3">Problems Faced and Conclusion</h3>
        <p class = "sitep">Over the course of the lab, I only encountered a few problems. First, it was difficult to use the multimeter because it was hard to hold the jumper cables
            to the multimeter. On top of that, taking a photo while already using both my hands to hold the multimeter proved to be difficult. I was able to solve this problem by having another student take the 
            photo, and I was able to hold the jumper cables to the grooves after some practice. Another issue I encountered was inserting items into the bread board. The wires on the 
            resistors tended to bend before being completely inserted into the holes on the breadboard. In the end, it simply took practice to be able to build the circuits. Overall, 
            I found this lab fairly easy to complete. The circuits were simple, and I feel that I accopmlished the lab's goal of learning how current flows through components and controlling the path
            of electricity. I built circuits using a LED, and I learned how to incorporate a switch in the form of a button in order to turn the LED on and off.
