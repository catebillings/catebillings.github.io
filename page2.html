          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <hr> 
          <ul class = "maintwo">

            <li><h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Professionally, I have a background in Aerospace Engineering. I studided it for two and a half
              years before I changed my major to Creative Technology and Design. I changed majors because I didn't 
              feel the passion that I once did for Aerospace Engineering. I wanted to do a broader major so that
              I could expand my creativity and eventually work for a company where I am truly passionate about what
              I am doing.
              
              Personally, my background is very big on family. I have three siblings: two sisters and one brother.
              I also have a dog named Bowie, pictured to the right. I spend an enormous amount of time with my family 
              I return home to Highlands Ranch often to see them.
            </p></li>
            <li><h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>My overall life goal will always be to find happiness. We are often led to believe success is the only
              goal in life, but I think happiness should be held above that. My professional goal is to find a career
              where I can creativly apply my tallents in design and technology, so my major is absolutely perfect
              to meet this goal. My goal for this course was to gain at least a basic understanding of different
              programming languages. I believe I achieved this goal because I created this website, and I have earned
              an excellent grade in this class.
